## ABOUT ME

I am a Geospatial Data Scientist passionate about research in the landscape of Climate Change  and Remote Sensing. I hold a Master of Engineering Degree in Computer Science and a Diploma in Meteorological Communication, Instrumentation and Information Systems from India Meteorological Department.
During the five recents years, I have consistently delivered compelling solutions for international environmental projects with Partners in Japan, Australia, Madagascar, Cameroon and Tanzania. I possess a proven track record of leveraging machine learning, earth observations and climate data to tackle complex challenges, particularly in agriculture and deforestation. For example, I recently worked as Product Manager in the international project ‚Äú Tackling Deforestation in Tanzania using Computer Vision and AI‚Äù. In collaboration with partners from Foreign Commonwealth, and Development Office and the National Carbon Monitoring Center, Govt of Tanzania , I lead a team of 15 AI engineers from 11 countries to build a web-based Geospatial application for analyzing deforestation trends in Rufiji Delta Region, Tanzania.
